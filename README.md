## Overview

This React-based web app uses a countries REST API to provide users with detailed information about countries worldwide. It features responsive design, search and filter functionalities, and detailed country profiles with interactive elements

## Users are able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page

## Continued development

I plan to add a "Dark Mode" toggle button to improve user experience. This feature will allow users to switch between light and dark themes seamlessly. Implementation will involve adding a toggle button in the UI, managing theme states using CSS variables or state management, and ensuring accessibility and user preference persistence
